# Multi-Agent EV Valuation — Dissertation Project

## 🚨 Version Disclaimer
This project has been tested with **Python 3.10** and **Python 3.11**.  
Some dependencies (e.g., AutoGluon) are **not compatible** with Python 3.12+ at the time of writing.  
If you are on a newer version (e.g., Python 3.13), you may need to create a virtual environment with Python 3.10 or 3.11 before installing dependencies.

## Overview
This repository contains the runnable code for my dissertation project, a modular multi-agent pipeline for short-horizon valuation of electric-vehicle companies. The system combines:
1) Fundamentals forecasting (Agent 1),
2) Expert-news sentiment using FinBERT (Agent 2),
3) Public-news sentiment using a GPT model (Agent 3),
4) A unified aggregation and ranking module (Agent 4).

The actual checkpoint for Agent 1 (AutoGluon ensemble) is large (~3 GB) and is stored outside the repository. Instructions to obtain it are below.

## Setup

1. **Download the Multi-Agent Core Files**
   To get started, download the zipped core files containing the main scripts:  
   [**Download multi_agent_core_files.zip**](https://github.com/S-Hari-B/Hari_Dissertation/raw/main/multi_agent_core_files.zip)  
   Extract the contents into the repository root.

2. **Install dependencies**
   Run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (This includes all required libraries in compatible versions.)

3. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file at the repository root based on `.env.example`:
   ```env
   AV_KEY=YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY
   OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_KEY
   ```

4. **Obtain the Agent 1 model checkpoint**
   Download the pre-trained model from Google Drive:  
   [Download Agent 1 Model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ncPJ9qA7HqvRZmGf5oc1ogy60kRxvvjU/view?usp=sharing)  
   After downloading:
   - Unzip or place the **entire** predictor folder at the path `./agent1_model` so that `./agent1_model/learner.pkl` and related files exist.
   - Do not rename internal files. Only the top-level directory should be `agent1_model`.

## Quick Start
Run the command-line tool and choose tickers from the predefined universe.
```bash
python unified_cli.py
```
The script will:
- Build a panel by querying Alpha Vantage for fundamentals and headlines,
- Score expert sentiment with FinBERT locally,
- Score public sentiment with GPT,
- Return a ranked list with a short rationale per company.

## Notes
- Alpha Vantage free tier is restrictive. Use a paid tier or run with fewer tickers to avoid hitting the quota.
- The `.env` file is read via `python-dotenv`.
- The OpenAI model used by default in the code is `gpt-4o-mini`. You can change `model=` in the relevant functions if needed.
- The first FinBERT run will download `yiyanghkust/finbert-tone` from Hugging Face to your cache.
- This project is for academic demonstration only. It does not provide financial advice.
